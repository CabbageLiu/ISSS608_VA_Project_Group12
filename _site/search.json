    "text": "“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”\n— Sherlock Holmes\nThey call it paradise. Oceanus — a remote island once known for its fishing heritage — now hosts yacht parties, drone shoots, and conservation protests. But for me, Clepper Jessen, it’s something else entirely: a mystery waiting to be unravelled.\nTwo weeks ago, something changed. Nemo Reef was abruptly shut down. Sailor Shift’s glamorous arrival was followed by a sudden storm of encrypted radio chatter, midnight movements, and fast-tracked approvals. Names I thought were long gone began to reappear — only this time, hidden behind pseudonyms like “The Boss” and “The Lookout.”\nWith my intern, I intercepted and parsed every message I could get my hands on. But a pile of transcripts, no matter how detailed, is like a thousand-piece puzzle without the picture on the box. I needed a new tool — one that could see what I couldn’t and connect what others wouldn’t.\nThat’s where this application comes in.\nThis is no ordinary dashboard. It is an investigative lens — built to:\n\nUncover temporal anomalies that hint at coordination,\nTrace power and influence through hidden networks,\nDecode aliases and reveal who’s hiding behind what name,\nSurface clusters of collaboration, dissent, or manipulation, and\nPiece together a case around suspects like Nadia Conti, whose past criminal ties may not be so past after all.\n\nWith every filter I apply and every link I explore, I come closer to the truth.\nOceanus wants to forget. My team is here to remember.\n\n\n\nOceanus is at a crossroads. Once a tranquil fishing haven, it now stands as a microcosm of modern tension — a battleground between commercial tourism, environmental activism, and quiet corruption. The sudden influx of celebrities, bureaucrats, and shadowy middlemen has triggered suspicion, particularly after the abrupt closure of Nemo Reef.\nAs an investigative journalist, I’ve seen patterns before. But this one? It’s tangled in layers of aliases, logistics, and unlikely partnerships. That’s why I needed a visual analytics tool — not just to read the data, but to interrogate it.\nThis project is driven by a desire to democratize investigative intelligence. Through interactive and intuitive visuals, it empowers those like me — and anyone who seeks truth — to:\n\nDetect daily patterns that ordinary eyes miss,\nFollow the thread of influence across vessels, people, and organizations,\nReveal pseudonyms and hold disguised actors accountable,\nMap out group behaviour and thematic alliances, and\nCollect visual evidence that separates fact from fabrication — especially in the case of Nadia Conti.\n\nBecause data may tell a story. But visual analytics lets us solve the case.\n\n\n\nThe intercepted radio communications have been transformed into a knowledge graph, capturing two weeks of activity between individuals, vessels, and organizations in Oceanus. Each node represents an entity, while edges represent relationships such as communication, approvals, or co-mentioning events. This knowledge graph also captures metadata like timestamps, topics, and pseudonyms.\nClepper Jessen suspects that behind the benign front of ocean tourism lies an orchestrated effort involving corruption, covert coordination, and manipulation of identity. Our task is to convert this static graph into an interactive investigative tool that surfaces hidden patterns and supports journalistic inquiry.\nInvestigative Problems include:\n🔸 Temporal Anomalies & Daily Rhythms\nMessages cluster around the same time daily, suggesting habitual or coordinated behaviour. Tracking shifts over time may expose operational changes before and after critical events (e.g., the filming announcement).\nGoal: Uncover periodic communication spikes, shifts in timing patterns, and correlation to entity activity.\n🔸Influence Mapping & Relationship Flows\nPower dynamics can be inferred from communication directionality and frequency. Entities like Sailor Shift, officials, and conservationists may be central nodes with high influence.\nGoal: Use graph metrics (e.g., betweenness, eigenvector centrality) to identify influencers and track their evolving roles.\n🔸Group Affiliation & Topic Clustering\nEntities form clusters — such as the Green Guardians or celebrity entourages — based on shared contacts or themes. Group-specific topics and interaction patterns can reveal operational roles.\nGoal: Detect communities using clustering algorithms and associate them with dominant discussion themes (e.g., tourism logistics vs. environmental protests).\n🔸Pseudonym Usage & Identity Masking\nPseudonyms like “The Boss” or “The Lookout” conceal true identities and complicate accountability. Some aliases may be reused across actors or tied to specific event types.\nGoal: Identify single or multi-user pseudonyms, map their activity and cross-compare behaviourally with known entities to uncover deception.\n🔸Evidence of Misconduct – Nadia Conti Focus\nClepper believes Nadia Conti may be covertly operating under new identities or aliases. Her history with illegal fishing makes her a person of interest in new corruption schemes.\nGoal: Map Nadia’s communication footprint, link indirect relationships via pseudonyms, and surface anomalies suggesting concealment or collusion.\n\n\n\nWe will develop a modular Shiny web app to convert the static knowledge graph into an interactive, investigative interface tailored to Clepper’s needs. Each module corresponds to a key problem statement.\nModule A: Temporal Pattern Explorer\nGoal: Visualize daily cycles and anomalies in communication frequency and topic intensity.\n\nInput: Message timestamp, sender, topic\nVisualization:\n\n-   Heatmap (Hour of day × Day) showing volume of messages\n-   Line chart overlay per sender/group (faceted if needed)\n-   Interactive brush to zoom into specific dates/times\n\nAdditional Feature: Compare activity of individual entities vs. global baseline\n\nModule B: Entity Influence Dashboard\nGoal: Reveal who influences whom across people, vessels, and organizations.\n\nInput: Entity-entity edges, directionality, frequency, topic weight\nBackend:\n\nCompute centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector)\nFilter by direction, topic, or message count\n\nVisualization:\n\nInteractive visNetwork graph with dynamic node sizing (influence) and colouring (group affiliation or topic)\nClickable entity profile cards that update to show:\n\nTop connections\nCommunication timeline\nTopics discussed\n\n\n\nModule C: Pseudonym Tracker\nGoal: Detect and decode pseudonym usage and role masking.\n\nInput: Entity-pseudonym mappings, message co-occurrence, behavioural similarity\nAlgorithm:\n\nIdentify pseudonyms via string detection, co-use clustering\nInfer multi-usage by examining shared communication patterns\n\nVisualization:\n\nNode-link diagram with toggle between “real” and “alias” modes\nHighlight shared aliases and suspicious handoffs of pseudonym identity\nTextual summary of evidence linking alias to probable identity\n\n\nModule D: Community & Topic Association\nGoal: Uncover hidden group structures and topic themes.\n\nBackend:\n\nApply Louvain clustering to full entity graph\nTag clusters with dominant communication themes (NLP topic tagging or keyword extraction)\n\nVisualization:\n\nFaceted layout by cluster: each showing node graph + summary\nBar chart of top topics per group\nHover tooltips to explain inter-group bridges (e.g., actors linking Sailor Shift’s crew with Green Guardians)\n\nModule E: Nadia Conti Activity Tracker\n\nGoal: Gather and visualize evidence of Nadia’s potential wrongdoing.\n\nInput: All messages involving or referring to Nadia or her aliases\nBackend:\n\nCreate Nadia subgraph: direct links, pseudonym usage, temporal footprint\nCompute abnormal communication patterns vs. baseline\n\nVisualization:\n\nTimeline of Nadia’s communications: who, when, and topic\nHighlight high-risk pseudonym periods or clandestine approvals\nSummary insight box: “Evidence Level: Moderate/Strong/None”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFully interactive network graph with edge filters (time, entity, topic)\nDynamic search for people, vessels, or pseudonyms\nSide panels showing metadata and inferred roles\nDownloadable visual summaries\nStoryboarding feature: Clepper can save key frames or views for investigation reports\n\n\n\n\n🔹 6.1 Home (Overview & Narrative Context)\n\nPurpose: Anchor the user with contextual background and investigative framing.\nComponents:\n\nShort narrative summary with quote from Clepper\nOptional interactive map of Oceanus (for future enhancement)\nInfoboxes showing key facts (e.g., number of entities, time span, known pseudonyms)\nNavigation buttons or sidebar leading to investigative tabs\n\nValue: Orients the user to the setting and stakes of the case; sets an investigative tone.\n\n🔹 6.2 Timeline Explorer Tab\n\nPurpose: Uncover daily and hourly communication patterns across the two-week observation window.\nComponents:\n\n📅 Heatmap: Date × Hour grid showing communication intensity\n📈 Line charts: Message frequency over time (overall or by entity/group)\n🔎 Interactive filters: Select entity type (people, vessels), specific names, or keyword topics\n🧭 Timeline brushing: Zoom in on specific dates to transition into more detailed tab\n\nValue: Highlights coordination patterns and anomalies\n\n🔹 6.3 Influence Drilldown Tab\n\nPurpose: Map out who holds power, and how they influence others within the knowledge graph.\nComponents:\n\n🕸️ Interactive visNetwork graph:\n\nNodes sized by centrality (influence)\nDirected edges colored by topic category (e.g., environmental, celebrity, logistics)\n\n🔁 Switch view: “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” influence\n📊 Side panel: Top 5 influencers, ego network for selected entity\n🗂️ Entity profile card: When clicked, show timeline of messages, role type, key connection\n\nValue: Supports influence tracing and actor prioritization, especially for figures like Sailor Shift, conservation leaders, and anonymous bureaucrats.\n\n🔹 6.4 Pseudonym Tracker Tab\n\nPurpose: Detect and decode the use of aliases and multi-identity patterns.\nComponents:\n\n👤 Alias network: Links pseudonyms to likely real-world identities based on co-activity\n🧬 Shared pseudonym highlighting (multiple entities using “Boss” at different hours)\n📅 Pseudonym timeline: Track when and how often each alias was used\n🛠️ Optional toggle: Show/hide pseudonyms in other tabs (global control)\n\nValue: Aids in exposing hidden actors and strengthens the foundation for behavioral de-anonymization.\n\n🔹 6.5 Community & Topic Cluster Tab\n\nPurpose: Visualize thematic groupings and entity communities within the network.\nComponents:\n\n🧠 Clustered graph layout (Louvain or Walktrap output)\n🎨 Color-coded communities with legend (e.g., Green = Environmentalists, Blue = Leisure Vessels)\n📚 Wordcloud or bar chart: Top keywords or message themes per group\n🔗 Bridge node detection: Show entities linking multiple clusters\n\nValue: Supports exploratory investigation into potential collaboration or conflict between stakeholder groups.\n\n🔹 6.6 Nadia Conti Case Dashboard\n\nPurpose: Build a narrative case file centered around Nadia Conti.\nComponents:\n\n🔍 Nadia’s entity profile + aliases\n📊 Summary panel: Activity volume, indirect connections, known pseudonyms\n⏳ Timeline view: Messages involving or referencing Nadia\n🧩 Inference section: Summary of potential illicit actions or suspicious interactions\n\nValue: Synthesizes cross-tab insights to evaluate the core investigative hypothesis: Is Nadia still engaging in illegal activity?\n\n🔹 6.7 (Optional) Evidence Builder Tab\n\nPurpose: Enable Clepper or the user to export selected visuals and insights for report writing or news publishing.\nComponents:\n\n📌 Bookmark key views from any tab\n📝 Generate narrative summaries or “case snapshots”\n📤 Export PDF/PNG visuals\n\nValue: Supports storytelling, publication, or handover to law enforcement or editorial teams.\n\n\n\n\nThis project proposes a purpose-built, investigative visual analytics application designed to illuminate the hidden relationships, pseudonym usage, and potential corruption embedded in the Oceanus radio communication dataset. By combining interactive graph-based exploration with temporal and entity-level analysis, the tool enables investigative users like Clepper Jessen to transition from static information to dynamic, evidence-based storytelling.\nBeyond solving the specific case of Nadia Conti and the suspicious activity around Nemo Reef, this application demonstrates how visual analytics can serve as a powerful ally in data-driven journalism, enabling the detection of influence, identity masking, and organized behaviour in semi-structured communications. Its modular design ensures adaptability for future investigative contexts, whether in civic watchdog efforts, environmental intelligence, or geopolitical monitoring.\nUltimately, this project aligns with the broader goal of democratizing data and analytics, offering a transparent and intuitive interface for domain experts to extract actionable insights from complex knowledge graphs — and to do so without requiring technical expertise in coding or graph theory."
